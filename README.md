# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Overview  
The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is an AI-powered web application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases, including diabetes, heart diseases, and Parkinson's disease. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient predictions based on user inputs. The application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud, making it easily accessible to anyone with internet access.
